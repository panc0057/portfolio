## About the Portfolio (How ir was created)

The final version of the portfolio was created in a short time.

Since my design ideas and the components of the site did not coincide with the existing artworks. In order to present my idea and how I want it to look, I had to draw all the main works presented on the site in a short time. Only after that, this portfolio site was created.

I am satisfied with the result and the fact that I was able to make it the way I intended. Despite the fact that I had to face a lot of difficulties.

### Challenges Faced

1. Finding Design Ideas
2. Make Artworks complement the Design

### Overcoming Challenges

1. Design Idea is found and pictires are complimenting it
